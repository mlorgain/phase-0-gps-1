##GPS 1.1 Reflection

#What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
    I was definitely struggling with the concepts of fetch and pull. I did not fully understand the difference between the two terminal commands, "git fetch <remote><branch>" and "git pull <remote><branch>" before starting this GPS session, although I suspected that there must be some inherent distiction between the two. 

    I was also struggling with conducting the proper workflow for pull requests, mostly because prior to this GPS we had only submitted and reviewed our own pull requests. I understood that in a conventional project workflow, one developer would submit a pull request and another developer would review and confirm it, but this process wasn't completely solidified for me until I saw it in action.  
#What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
    Both of the concepts I mentioned above were, thankfully, clarifed in this GPS session. My GPS guide, Peter, explained that git pull is essentially the same as using the two commands git fetch and git merge together, but that it is useful to be able to know how to use git fetch and git merge in place of git pull so that we have a better understand of the innerworkings of the git pull command, espeically for instances where the git pull command may go awry. 

    This GPS session also solidified my understanding of the pull request workflow. Working with Gabriel to successfully complete a pull request with one person submitting it and the other reviewing it, and being able to explore some of the other options available in commenting and review diff clarified a lot for me and taught me some new tricks.
