What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

Both Myra and I were wondering about the difference between git fetch and pull, and we were generally hesitant about all the git commands even though we had used them before. There were often points where we realized that we made errors like forgetting to commit our files. 

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

Another practice run using GitHub was very helpful to iron out the kinks, and our guide clarified some of the motivations to use a repository. I think the most helpful aspect was not new knowledge but a revision and reinforcement of skills we had only cursory knowledge of. 

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

What's the difference between fetch and pull in git? 
Why do we need to both add and commit our files in git?
Do we need to manually delete the branches we made after pulling a remote master branch that doesn't contain the local sub-branches? 

What still confuses you about Git?

I'm getting the hang of it; I think more than areas of confusing I merely have areas of ignorance. I clearly need to explore more. 

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

At first, I was a really awkward guide, and I didn't have the GPS module up--it was pretty rough. But we ironed out the kinks and I know that the next will be better. I liked it a lot; it was nice to have a personal connection with someone who's every bit as clueless as I am, and Myra, my pair, was very pleasany to work with.
